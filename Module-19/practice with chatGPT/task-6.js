/**Task: Filter and Transform Custom Objects
You have an array of student objects. Each student has:
name (string)
marks (number)
passed (boolean)
ðŸ‘‰ Your job is to:
Filter the students who passed and have marks more than 80.
Create a new array that contains only the names of those filtered students in uppercase. */
